<h1><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c1b10e5-5256-4ec3-846f-c72cffc0a7b4" width="90" height="90" /> Hey there!</h1>
<h3>I'm Alexis Chan (she/her), a Computer Science and Finance double major at NC State University and a proud Park Scholar. I'm passionate about leveraging technology and finance to lead sustainable, community-centered solutions that last beyond the prototype. </h3>


<h1>Drive & Direction</h1>
<h3>While I enjoy the energy and creativity of hackathons, I’ve realized that sustainable innovation requires time—time to research, time to understand user needs, and time to iterate thoughtfully. That’s why I created InSPIRE, a program within the Women in Computer Science (WiCS) chapter at NCSU focused on long-term, values-driven solutions that aim to inspire participants to code their passion projects.</3>
